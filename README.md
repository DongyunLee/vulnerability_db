# The Database About CNVD

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

This is a database about CNVD.
This repository has been coding with ThinkPHP5.1,
Which is a LTS version.

**Warning:** This repo is developing, so **DON'T** use it on the Product Environment.

## INSTALL
It's not supported the composer install because it's developing.
But I wanna to support it on the not far future.

And now ,you can install it by git.

1. ``git clone https://github.com/DongyunLee/vulnerability_db.git cnvd_vdb``
2.  `cd cnvd_vdb`
3. `comopser install`

If you don't have all of [these require items](composer.json),you will have an error from composer.

Or not , look about next !

## USAGE
###### I haven't been written the `Index` module,so you can visit the `Fetch` module only.

*By the way, The `Index` module will be the list of the data what you have been imported.
and the `Fetch` module will help you import the xml from [CNVD](https://cnvd.org.cn).*

**Before that, look about [this document](https://www.kancloud.cn/manual/thinkphp5_1/353955),
it's the official document of ThinkPHP v5.1 to teach you how to rewrite the url to deploy this site.**

### Get XML from [CNVD](https://cnvd.org.cn)
1. Visit the [CNVD](https://cnvd.org.cn) and Login it.
2. visit the [page](https://www.cnvd.org.cn/shareData/list) and get the id of link,
    eg:
    > https://www.cnvd.org.cn/shareData/download/571

    ``php think down The_ID_you_have_been_got_in_step_2``
